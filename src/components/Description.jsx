      Hello, my name is Kyle McParland. <br/><br/>
      Roslindale is a balancing act of style, service, and sentiment. It’s a
      serif that is chunky in text and slick in display, pitting sharp, stubby
      serifs against round, bulbous terminals. It tries to be an old-style serif
      with hints of diagonal stress, but in the end it can’t shake its Victorian
      roots. <br/><br/>The family follows in the footsteps of De Vinne, an 1890s typeface
      from Central Type Foundry that was named after the renowned 19th-century
      printer. Building upon the smoother, sleeker takes on the style that
      became popular in the 1970s, Roslindale completes De Vinne’s
      transformation from a lumpy Victorian curiosity into a versatile
      contemporary type system. It still might be a bit cheesy at times, but
      it’s more like a creamy brie than a stinky bleu.
